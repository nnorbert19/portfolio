        I'm some kind of an explorer. I want to understand how stuff works. When
        I was a kid I was a big fan of video games, so i remade some of them in
        my own version. From that point on I constantly looking for
        opportunities to learn something new. That's why I built this website.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future I want to learn about UI/UX and some backend stuff, so I
        could become a Fullstack developer.
