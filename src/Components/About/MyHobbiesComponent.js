        I love to do a lot of things in my freetime, but i Want to mention a few
        of these. I like to explore, thats why I like to hike. I think being in
        the nature is the most relaxing thing. I already been in many places at
        KÃ©kes and I want to explore more mountains in the future.

        Sometimes I want to show others how I see the world. So I started
        learning about photography a year ago.
